# Resources Used in Student Analysis AIML Club

## Datasets
- [Meteorite data](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings-api) : Meteorite Landings API : API using comprehensive data set from The Meteoritical Society that contains information on all of the known meteorite landings.

## Libraries/Frameworks
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) : *pandas* is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) : *NumPy* brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. With this power comes simplicity: a solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant.

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) : *Matplotlib* comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

- [plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) : *plotly.express* Plotly Express is a terse, consistent, high-level API for creating figures. Used mainly for marking points on the map in this project.

- [re — Regular expression operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) : *re — Regular expression operations* A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).


## Articles & Tutorials
- [Meteorite wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite): This article is about debris from space that survives impact with the ground.

- [Meteorite classification wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_classification): In meteoritics, a meteorite classification system attempts to group similar meteorites and allows scientists to communicate with a standardized terminology when discussing them. Meteorites are classified according to a variety of characteristics, especially mineralogical, petrological, chemical, and isotopic properties.
