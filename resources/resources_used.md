# Resources Used in Student Analysis AIML Club

## Datasets
- [Meteorite data](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings-api) : Meteorite Landings API : API using comprehensive data set from The Meteoritical Society that contains information on all of the known meteorite landings.

## Libraries/Frameworks
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) : *pandas* is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) : *NumPy* brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. With this power comes simplicity: a solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant.

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) : *Matplotlib* comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

- [plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) : *plotly.express* Plotly Express is a terse, consistent, high-level API for creating figures. Used mainly for marking points on the map in this project.

- [re — Regular expression operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) : *re — Regular expression operations* A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).

- [librosa](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) : *librosa* python package for music and audio analysis. It provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems.



## Articles & Tutorials
- [Meteorite wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite): This article is about debris from space that survives impact with the ground.

- [Meteorite classification wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_classification): In meteoritics, a meteorite classification system attempts to group similar meteorites and allows scientists to communicate with a standardized terminology when discussing them. Meteorites are classified according to a variety of characteristics, especially mineralogical, petrological, chemical, and isotopic properties.

- [Linear Regression wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression): In statistics, linear regression is a model that estimates the relationship between a scalar response (dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (regressor or independent variable).
  
- [Linear Regression geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/ml-linear-regression/): Linear regression is a type of supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on new datasets.

- [Audio Agumentation](https://medium.com/@joshiprerak123/transforming-sound-audio-augmentation-in-python-89c1c08a836b) : Audio augmentation is a powerful technique used in machine learning and deep learning to artificially expand and diversify audio datasets. This process involves creating modified versions of existing audio samples by applying various transformations, without changing the underlying content or label of the audio.

## Tools
- [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): For making code and running AI models.

## Others
- [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition
by Aurélien Géron](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/): Through a series of recent breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This practical book shows you how.
